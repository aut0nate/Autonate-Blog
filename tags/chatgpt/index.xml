Aside from the organisational aspects of Projects, it is such a powerful way to interact with ChatGPT because it allows you to add custom instructions and files specifically related to the project. This is very important as it provides context for the model, and context is key when interacting with Large Language Models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, I sat here trying to create the perfect custom project instructions and, despite my best efforts, I was not entirely satisfied with the output. I realised I was spending way too much time manually drafting custom instructions for my ChatGPT Projects. I kept running into the same problem: &lt;strong&gt;prompt structure&lt;/strong&gt;. Then the penny dropped: I realised I could just use ChatGPT to help me build this, and so I built a &lt;strong&gt;Prompt Generator GPT&lt;/strong&gt;. I worked iteratively with GPT-5, asking the model to ask me clarifying questions to help me design a &lt;strong&gt;prompt&lt;/strong&gt; which will allow me to build project instructions for a wide range of subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with GPTs: How I Built a Custom Assistant to Learn Linux</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/getting-started-with-gpts-how-i-built-a-custom-assistant-to-learn-linux/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/getting-started-with-gpts-how-i-built-a-custom-assistant-to-learn-linux/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2023 OpenAI introduced &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpts/"&gt;GPTs&lt;/a&gt; — custom versions of ChatGPT that anyone can create. These tailored assistants are designed to perform specific tasks, help with workflows, or simply provide a more personalised experience. In this post, I’ll explain what GPTs are, why they’re so useful, and how I created a custom GPT to help me learn Linux commands.&lt;/p&gt;

As a ChatGPT Plus subscriber, I’ve gained access to this new model, albeit with frustratingly low rate limits that I hope will improve in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that, the excitement I am feeling is real. GPT-4 feels like a gear shift, a real turning point, not just in AI capability, but in how I personally approach learning. I’ve been experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs) for some time now, mainly to augment my learning around technical subjects. With GPT-4, that approach feels more powerful than ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
