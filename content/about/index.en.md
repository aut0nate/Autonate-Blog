👋🏻 Hi, I’m Nathan, a UK-based technical professional with hands-on experience working across Linux, Windows, and macOS environments. I enjoy working with a broad range of technologies and feel comfortable moving between platforms, tools, and workflows to support both development and operations teams.

My primary areas of focus include AI, Automation, System Administration, Cloud Computing, and DevOps. I have a strong interest in using automation and AI-driven tools to reduce manual effort, improve reliability, and streamline business processes. I enjoy exploring how modern AI platforms, APIs, and automation frameworks can be applied practically to solve real-world problems rather than used for novelty alone.

Knowledge management and documentation are a core part of how I work and learn. I place a strong emphasis on clear, structured documentation, treating it as both a learning tool and a long-term reference. Whether documenting systems, processes, or experiments, I aim to create resources that are easy to understand, reusable, and valuable to others.
