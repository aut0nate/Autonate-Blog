That hasn’t changed. Reading documentation, exploring blog posts, and watching tutorials are still essential parts of the learning process. What has changed for me is how I bring all of that material together. The tool I use to do that is &lt;a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NotebookLM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which has slotted neatly into my learning toolkit, helping me research, retain, and make sense of the information.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building My Own Prompt Generator GPT</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/building-my-own-prompt-generator-gpt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/building-my-own-prompt-generator-gpt/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I love using &lt;a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10169521-projects-in-chatgpt"&gt;Projects&lt;/a&gt; to organise my chats. Aside from the organisational aspects of Projects, it is such a powerful way to interact with ChatGPT because it allows you to add custom instructions and files specifically related to the project. This is very important as it provides context for the model, and context is key when interacting with Large Language Models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, I sat here trying to create the perfect custom project instructions and, despite my best efforts, I was not entirely satisfied with the output. I realised I was spending way too much time manually drafting custom instructions for my ChatGPT Projects. I kept running into the same problem: &lt;strong&gt;prompt structure&lt;/strong&gt;. Then the penny dropped: I realised I could just use ChatGPT to help me build this, and so I built a &lt;strong&gt;Prompt Generator GPT&lt;/strong&gt;. I worked iteratively with GPT-5, asking the model to ask me clarifying questions to help me design a &lt;strong&gt;prompt&lt;/strong&gt; which will allow me to build project instructions for a wide range of subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How I Use Perplexity to Stay Informed and Learn New Skills</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/how-i-use-perplexity-to-stay-informed-and-learn-new-skills/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/how-i-use-perplexity-to-stay-informed-and-learn-new-skills/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If there’s one AI tool I reach for every day without fail, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.perplexity.ai"&gt;Perplexity&lt;/a&gt;. It has become my go-to assistant for staying up to date with the latest news and exploring new topics. I wanted to share how I use it, why I keep coming back to it, and a few features I think are genuinely worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it is a quick fact, the latest headlines, or a deep dive into a new topic, search engines have always been the gateway to discovery. For me, that changed in 2023, when I discovered &lt;a href="https://www.perplexity.ai"&gt;Perplexity&lt;/a&gt;—an AI-powered research tool that’s quietly revolutionised how I find and use information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional search engines have always been about links. Type a query, get a list of websites, and hope the answer is buried somewhere on page one. Perplexity takes a different approach: it delivers direct, well-sourced answers to your questions, right up front. No more hopping between tabs or skimming articles for a single fact. The experience is more like chatting with a knowledgeable assistant than using a search engine.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with GPTs: How I Built a Custom Assistant to Learn Linux</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/getting-started-with-gpts-how-i-built-a-custom-assistant-to-learn-linux/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/getting-started-with-gpts-how-i-built-a-custom-assistant-to-learn-linux/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2023 OpenAI introduced &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpts/"&gt;GPTs&lt;/a&gt; — custom versions of ChatGPT that anyone can create. These tailored assistants are designed to perform specific tasks, help with workflows, or simply provide a more personalised experience. In this post, I’ll explain what GPTs are, why they’re so useful, and how I created a custom GPT to help me learn Linux commands.&lt;/p&gt;

As someone with an M1 Pro MacBook Pro, I was intrigued by the idea of leveraging my hardware to run advanced AI models privately. After exploring Ollama and experimenting with open-source models like &lt;strong&gt;Llama&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Mistral&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Phi&lt;/strong&gt;, I’ve been amazed at the speed and quality these models deliver—especially considering they’re running locally.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Understanding Prompt Engineering: The Art of Communicating with LLMs</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/understanding-prompt-engineering-the-art-of-communicating-with-llms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/understanding-prompt-engineering-the-art-of-communicating-with-llms/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Prompt engineering is a crucial skill in today’s AI-driven world. At its core, it’s the process of designing and optimising prompts to interact effectively with natural language processing (NLP) models like ChatGPT. Crafting a good prompt is an art and a science, and when done well, it can drastically improve the quality of responses from AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re writing prompts for work, learning, or creative projects, understanding the basics of prompt engineering can make your interactions with AI more productive and rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The AI Explosion: How It’s Changing the Way We Work and Live</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/the-ai-explosion-how-its-changing-the-way-we-work-and-live/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/the-ai-explosion-how-its-changing-the-way-we-work-and-live/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We’re living in the middle of an AI revolution. The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence feel like the dawn of a new era—much like how the internet and the World Wide Web transformed the way we live, communicate, and work. In just a few short years, AI has gone from a buzzword to a daily tool many of us use, and the pace of progress shows no signs of slowing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>First Impressions of GPT-4</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/first-impressions-of-gpt-4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/first-impressions-of-gpt-4/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It’s only been a few weeks since OpenAI released GPT-4, and I’ve already been putting it to work. As a ChatGPT Plus subscriber, I’ve gained access to this new model, albeit with frustratingly low rate limits that I hope will improve in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that, the excitement I am feeling is real. GPT-4 feels like a gear shift, a real turning point, not just in AI capability, but in how I personally approach learning. I’ve been experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs) for some time now, mainly to augment my learning around technical subjects. With GPT-4, that approach feels more powerful than ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
