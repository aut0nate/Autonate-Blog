I genuinely enjoy working across all the major operating systems, from Linux and macOS to Windows itself—I’ve found that Windows has evolved in some really interesting ways, especially when it comes to Linux and Open Source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the very first things I do when setting up a new Windows system is make sure the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about"&gt;Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)&lt;/a&gt; is installed and configured just the way I like it. I’ve been using WSL on a daily basis for years, and it’s become an essential part of my workflow, allowing me to run all the Linux tools I need in a familiar, integrated environment. Plus, it’s improved massively since I first tried it out on Windows 10 back in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
