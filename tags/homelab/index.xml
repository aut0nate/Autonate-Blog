For a long time, the backbone of that software setup was Portainer. Portainer served as the graphical interface for managing the 20+ services I run in stacks on my VPS, handling everything from my reverse proxy to monitoring tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portainer is a robust GUI for managing containers and stacks, and I want to make it clear that my migration wasn&amp;rsquo;t driven by any failing on its part; it’s an excellent piece of kit. However, as my homelab evolved, I started looking for something that offered an even &lt;strong&gt;simpler and easier management experience&lt;/strong&gt;. I wanted a dedicated tool that stripped back the complexity, allowing me to focus entirely on tweaking my Docker Compose files and stacks. That search led me straight to &lt;a href="https://dockge.kuma.pet/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dockge&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Glance: My Favourite Homelab Dashboard</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/glance-my-favourite-homelab-dashboard/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/glance-my-favourite-homelab-dashboard/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/glanceapp/glance"&gt;Glance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as the primary dashboard for my homelab, and it has quickly become one of my most-used tools. Glance allows me to monitor all my Docker containers, network devices, and services at a glance (pun intended), all within a clean, minimalist interface. It’s lightweight, fast, and extremely customisable, giving me real-time visibility into my entire environment.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;span class="me-2"&gt;What Is Glance?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;a href="#what-is-glance" class="anchor text-muted"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glance is a self-hosted dashboard that you can configure entirely through a simple YAML file. It’s designed for speed, clarity, and ease of maintenance while giving you total control over layout and content. You can display container statuses, system metrics, bookmarks, RSS feeds, or even pull live data from APIs. It offers a clean, centralised view. of the information that matters most, keeping everything organised and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Discovering n8n: The Workflow Automation Platform</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/discovering-n8n-the-workflow-automation-platform/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/discovering-n8n-the-workflow-automation-platform/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Automation has always fascinated me for its ability to simplify complex processes and free up time for creative work. That curiosity naturally led me to explore new tools and that’s how I discovered &lt;strong&gt;n8n&lt;/strong&gt;, a workflow automation platform that has quickly become one of my favourite tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept seeing videos and articles about n8n pop up and it was one of those tools that never quite left my “must-try” list. As someone who’s passionate about automation, I was curious to see what made it stand out. Once I started digging deeper, I quickly realised how powerful and flexible it was.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My Cloud Homelab Setup</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/my-cloud-homelab-setup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/my-cloud-homelab-setup/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started exploring the world of homelabs, I thought it had to involve racks of hardware, blinking lights, and endless tinkering. I even wrote about my early experiments &lt;a href="https://blog.autonate.dev/posts/my-homelab-journey/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, I repurposed an old desktop PC and dived head-first into virtualisation with Proxmox, containers, and self-hosted services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun, but I quickly realised that what really interested me wasn’t the hardware - it was the &lt;strong&gt;software and services&lt;/strong&gt;. I loved spinning up tools, learning how they worked, and making them accessible on my own terms. The hardware side, while interesting, left me feeling stuck in “decision paralysis”, what’s the perfect setup? What hardware should I buy next? Should I build a Kubernetes cluster? Instead of enjoying the process, I was constantly second-guessing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tailscale Saves the Day</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/tailscale-saves-the-day/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/tailscale-saves-the-day/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="https://blog.autonate.dev/posts/tailscale-homelab/"&gt;previous post about Tailscale&lt;/a&gt;, I covered what Tailscale is and why it’s become a staple in my homelab toolkit. Today, I want to share a real-world example of just how handy it can be—specifically, how it helped me retrieve personal documents from my homelab while sat on a train, armed with nothing more than my iPhone and a 5G connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-situation-needing-remote-access-on-the-go" id=the-situation-needing-remote-access-on-the-go&gt;
 
 &lt;span class="me-2"&gt;The Situation: Needing Remote Access on the Go&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;a href="#the-situation-needing-remote-access-on-the-go" class="anchor text-muted"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been there: you need a file, but it’s tucked away on your home network, and you’re nowhere near your desk. For me, this happened while I was on a train, miles away from home. The documents I needed were only accessible from my local network—or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Taildrop: Secure File Sharing from Anywhere with Tailscale</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/taildrop-secure-file-sharing-from-anywhere-with-tailscale/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/taildrop-secure-file-sharing-from-anywhere-with-tailscale/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tailscale has transformed the way I manage and access my homelab, providing seamless, secure connectivity between all my devices—wherever I am. In my previous post, &lt;a href="https://blog.autonate.dev/posts/tailscale-homelab/"&gt;&amp;ldquo;How Tailscale Transformed Secure Access to My Homelab&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I shared how Tailscale has become an essential part of my daily workflow, enabling remote access to servers, VMs, and services without exposing anything to the public internet. Today, I want to highlight another standout feature: Taildrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-taildrop" id=what-is-taildrop&gt;
 
 &lt;span class="me-2"&gt;What is Taildrop?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;a href="#what-is-taildrop" class="anchor text-muted"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taildrop is a built-in feature of Tailscale that allows you to securely send files between any devices connected to your Tailnet. Taildrop transfers files over encrypted peer-to-peer connections, using the fastest available path. This makes it a great solution for sending sensitive or large files without third-party servers in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How Tailscale Transformed Secure Access to My Homelab</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/how-tailscale-transformed-secure-access-to-my-homelab/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/how-tailscale-transformed-secure-access-to-my-homelab/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Connecting to services in a homelab can be a headache, especially when you want strong security without the hassle of port forwarding, firewall rules, or wrestling with certificates. Last year, I discovered &lt;a href="https://tailscale.com/"&gt;Tailscale&lt;/a&gt; and introduced it to my &lt;a href="https://blog.autonate.dev/posts/my-homelab-journey/"&gt;homelab&lt;/a&gt;. Tailscale has become my solution for secure, reliable, and zero-fuss access to certain services in my homelab—which I do not want to expose via the public internet. In this post, I’ll walk through what makes Tailscale so effective, how to set it up, and the best practices I’ve picked up along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My Homelab Journey...So Far</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/my-homelab-journey...so-far/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/my-homelab-journey...so-far/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Diving into the world of Linux naturally led me to discover the vibrant homelab community. What began as casual curiosity soon became a genuine fascination, fuelled by countless YouTube videos showcasing everything from compact, single-board computers to sprawling, business-grade server racks. The creativity and technical depth on display resonated with my own desire to experiment and learn by doing. But as I watched, a set of questions began to form: Did I actually need a homelab? What would I use it for? Did it require a significant investment in hardware? And, crucially, how should I even begin?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
