Today, I want to share a real-world example of just how handy it can be—specifically, how it helped me retrieve personal documents from my homelab while sat on a train, armed with nothing more than my iPhone and a 5G connection.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;span class="me-2"&gt;The Situation: Needing Remote Access on the Go&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been there: you need a file, but it’s tucked away on your home network, and you’re nowhere near your desk. For me, this happened while I was on a train, miles away from home. The documents I needed were only accessible from my local network—or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Taildrop: Secure File Sharing from Anywhere with Tailscale</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/taildrop-secure-file-sharing-from-anywhere-with-tailscale/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/taildrop-secure-file-sharing-from-anywhere-with-tailscale/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tailscale has transformed the way I manage and access my homelab, providing seamless, secure connectivity between all my devices—wherever I am. In my previous post, &lt;a href="https://blog.autonate.dev/posts/tailscale-homelab/"&gt;&amp;ldquo;How Tailscale Transformed Secure Access to My Homelab&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I shared how Tailscale has become an essential part of my daily workflow, enabling remote access to servers, VMs, and services without exposing anything to the public internet. Today, I want to highlight another standout feature: Taildrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-taildrop" id=what-is-taildrop&gt;
 
 &lt;span class="me-2"&gt;What is Taildrop?&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;a href="#what-is-taildrop" class="anchor text-muted"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taildrop is a built-in feature of Tailscale that allows you to securely send files between any devices connected to your Tailnet. Taildrop transfers files over encrypted peer-to-peer connections, using the fastest available path. This makes it a great solution for sending sensitive or large files without third-party servers in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How Tailscale Transformed Secure Access to My Homelab</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/how-tailscale-transformed-secure-access-to-my-homelab/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/how-tailscale-transformed-secure-access-to-my-homelab/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Connecting to services in a homelab can be a headache, especially when you want strong security without the hassle of port forwarding, firewall rules, or wrestling with certificates. Last year, I discovered &lt;a href="https://tailscale.com/"&gt;Tailscale&lt;/a&gt; and introduced it to my &lt;a href="https://blog.autonate.dev/posts/my-homelab-journey/"&gt;homelab&lt;/a&gt;. Tailscale has become my solution for secure, reliable, and zero-fuss access to certain services in my homelab—which I do not want to expose via the public internet. In this post, I’ll walk through what makes Tailscale so effective, how to set it up, and the best practices I’ve picked up along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
