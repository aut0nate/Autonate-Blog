Welcome to **blog.autonate.dev** — my personal blog and technical knowledge base, hosted on GitHub Pages.
It serves as a living repository of notes, guides, and practical write-ups based on hands-on learning and real-world experience.

## Purpose

This blog exists to:

* Document what I’m learning, building, and experimenting with.
* Share practical, no-nonsense technical guides.
* Act as a long-term reference for systems, tools, and workflows.
* Showcase projects and ideas in a clear, structured way.

The focus is on *learning by doing*, with an emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and real use cases rather than theory alone.

## Content Themes

The blog covers a broad but related set of technical areas, including:

* **AI**: Exploring LLM's, AI tools, workflows, prompt engineering, and how AI integrates into everyday life.

* **Cloud Computing & DevOps**: Exploring Azure, Docker, Kubernetes Containers, CI/CD, automation and DevOps best practices.

* **Linux System Administration**: Exploring the command line, tools, system configuration, performance, and best practices across various distros.

* **Scripting & Automation**: Working with Bash, PowerShell, Power Automate, n8n and Apple Shortcuts for improving efficiency.

* **Operating Systems**: Working productively across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.

* **Productivity**: Exploring Tools, techniques, and systems that support focus, organisation, and efficiency.

## Site Architecture

The site is built as a fast, lightweight static blog with a focus on readability and maintainability.

* **Static Site Generator**: **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**
* **Theme**: **[Chirpy (Hugo)](https://github.com/geekifan/hugo-theme-chirpy)**
  A Hugo port of the popular [Jekyll Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy), chosen for its clean layout and documentation-friendly design.
* **Hosting**: **GitHub Pages**

Content is written in Markdown and version-controlled, making it easy to evolve the site alongside ongoing learning.
