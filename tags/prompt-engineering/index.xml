Aside from the organisational aspects of Projects, it is such a powerful way to interact with ChatGPT because it allows you to add custom instructions and files specifically related to the project. This is very important as it provides context for the model, and context is key when interacting with Large Language Models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, I sat here trying to create the perfect custom project instructions and, despite my best efforts, I was not entirely satisfied with the output. I realised I was spending way too much time manually drafting custom instructions for my ChatGPT Projects. I kept running into the same problem: &lt;strong&gt;prompt structure&lt;/strong&gt;. Then the penny dropped: I realised I could just use ChatGPT to help me build this, and so I built a &lt;strong&gt;Prompt Generator GPT&lt;/strong&gt;. I worked iteratively with GPT-5, asking the model to ask me clarifying questions to help me design a &lt;strong&gt;prompt&lt;/strong&gt; which will allow me to build project instructions for a wide range of subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Understanding Prompt Engineering: The Art of Communicating with LLMs</title><link>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/understanding-prompt-engineering-the-art-of-communicating-with-llms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.autonate.dev/post/understanding-prompt-engineering-the-art-of-communicating-with-llms/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Prompt engineering is a crucial skill in today’s AI-driven world. At its core, it’s the process of designing and optimising prompts to interact effectively with natural language processing (NLP) models like ChatGPT. Crafting a good prompt is an art and a science, and when done well, it can drastically improve the quality of responses from AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re writing prompts for work, learning, or creative projects, understanding the basics of prompt engineering can make your interactions with AI more productive and rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
